# messagingapp
built in android
a real messaging app would require much more code to handle things like authentication, error handling, and storing messages in a database. It's also worth noting that this example uses a fictional Message and MessageListener class, and you would need to define these classes and implement the necessary functionality.
code uses a fictional ServerAPI class to send a login request to the server and handle the response. The User class is also a fictional class that represents a user of the app. You would need to define these classes and implement the necessary functionality.
To store messages in a database in the messaging app from my previous examples, you will need to do the following:

Choose a database system to use. There are many options available, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. Each has its own strengths and limitations, so you will need to choose the one that is best suited to your needs.

Set up a server to host your database. This will involve installing and configuring the database software, as well as creating a database and tables to store your data.

Write code to store and retrieve messages from the database. This will involve writing SQL queries to insert, update, and select data from the database. You will also need to write code to connect to the database from your app and execute these queries.
To retrieve messages from a database in the messaging app from my previous examples, you will need to write a SQL query to select the messages you want to retrieve, and then execute the query using a prepared statement.
This code creates a prepared statement to select all rows from the messages table in the database, executes the statement, and iterates through the result set to create a list of Message objects. The Message class is a fictional class that represents a message in the app, and you would need to define this class and implement the necessary functionality.
A transaction is a sequence of database operations that are treated as a single unit of work. Transactions are used to ensure that database changes are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable (ACID).
This code turns off auto-commit mode on the connection, which allows multiple statements to be grouped into a single transaction. It then inserts a message into the messages table and attempts to retrieve it using a prepared statement. If the message is found, the transaction is committed and the changes are made permanent. If the message is not found, the transaction is rolled back and the changes are discarded.
This code uses a try-catch block to handle any exceptions that may occur when executing the prepared statement. If an exception is caught, it is logged using the Android Log class and a message is shown to the user.
